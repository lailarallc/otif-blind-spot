# OTIF Blind Spot — Project Context for Claude

## What this project is

A Lailara portfolio diagnostic piece for specialty food brands ($3M–$20M revenue) that reconciles the brand's internal fill rate against retailer OTIF scorecards and exposes the blind spot between them. The brand thinks it ships at 99%; only 84.5% of its Walmart shipments arrive on time and complete. (Walmart's own case-level OTIF passes: 95.6% on-time, 97.9% in-full, 2025.) This analysis decomposes the 14.8-point gap into on-time vs. in-full failures, attributes root causes to warehouse-late vs. carrier-late vs. short-ship vs. receiving-discrepancy, and quantifies the full exposure — OTIF fines plus the shelf-velocity damage the empty shelves created. Built on the Cinderhaven Data Platform using synthetic Walmart OTIF scorecard data. Part of the short-ship workstream alongside The 150 Cases (cost) and Production Demand Forecast (prevention).

**Business question this project answers:** Why does Cinderhaven's 99% internal fill rate coexist with only 84.5% of Walmart shipments arriving on time and complete, what failure modes drive the gap, and what does it cost in chargebacks and velocity damage?

## Tier

Medium — standard workflow: `/clarify`, `/ce:brainstorm`, `/ce:plan`, `/ce:work`, `/ce:review`, `/ce:compound`.

## Stack and tools

- Primary language: TypeScript/React (frontend) + Python (data pipeline)
- Key packages/libraries: React 19, Vite, Observable Plot, Vitest (frontend); psycopg2 (pipeline)
- Platform: Cinderhaven Data Platform (shipment, EDI, PO and receipt marts)
- Entry point: `frontend/src/main.tsx` (app); `scripts/run_pipeline.py` (data regen)
- Other tools: Wrangler (Cloudflare Workers deploy), pre-commit + gitleaks (secret scanning)

## Project files

- CLAUDE.md (this file) — permanent rules and facts
- DECISIONS.md — durable choices and reasoning
- HANDOFF.md — current session state
- PLAN.md — current work arc
- FAILURES.md — things tried that didn't work
- docs/solutions/ — documented solutions to past problems (ui bugs, best practices, workflow patterns), organized by category with YAML frontmatter (module, tags, problem_type)

Read PLAN.md and HANDOFF.md at session start. DECISIONS.md and FAILURES.md as relevant.

## Voice and standards

- Economist style: sober, declarative, data-forward
- No marketing voice ("leverage," "synergy," "best-in-class," "unlock," "drive value")
- No hedging that softens a real finding
- Charts must be readable by non-data-scientist audiences
- Plain English that tells the truth as the data presents it

## Rules

### Honesty and judgment

- Say "I don't know" or "I can't verify this" instead of guessing.
  This applies to industry context, technical claims, what code did,
  and anything else.
- Tell me what I need to hear, not what I want to hear. If a decision
  looks wrong, say so. If code I wrote has problems, say so. Honest
  assessment, not validation.
- If a rule in this file is too vague to verify whether you're
  following it, flag it for revision rather than guessing at compliance.

### Building and proposing

- No speculative abstractions. If something isn't needed right now,
  don't build it. Helper functions get added when called by real code,
  not in anticipation. Parameters get added when there's a second use
  case, not the first.
- When proposing a tool, library, or approach, present at least two
  alternatives with tradeoffs, even if one is clearly preferred. Do
  not propose a single solution and move on.
- Tie proposals back to the business question this project is
  answering. If you can't connect a proposal to that question, the
  proposal is probably fluff and should be reconsidered.

### How to work the project

- Work in vertical slices, not horizontal phases. Build one feature
  end-to-end (working from input to output) before moving to the next.
- When a feature is working, suggest a simple test to verify it stays
  working: "This works now — want to add a quick test so it doesn't
  break later?" Don't force testing, but make it easy to say yes.
- Do not start tasks outside the current PLAN.md arc without flagging
  it to the user first.
- Do not refactor unrelated code unprompted.
- Do not rename things unless asked.

### Git branching

- Before risky or experimental changes, suggest creating a branch.
- What counts as "risky": changing how the project is structured,
  trying a new library, rewriting a working feature.
- Keep it simple: `git checkout -b experiment/short-description`
  before the change, merge back to main if it works.

### Scope creep detection

- Periodically check whether the current work matches PLAN.md. If the
  user has been building something not in the plan for more than ~15
  minutes, flag it.
- Also flag if PLAN.md keeps growing without items completing.

## Working with PLAN.md

PLAN.md defines the current arc of work. Read it at session start.

- Mark tasks complete as they're finished, in the same commit as the work
- If a task is wrong-sized, in the wrong order, or no longer relevant,
  flag it rather than silently restructuring

## Session reminders

### Reminding the user to /log

Prompt the user to run /log when:

- A meaningful change just landed
- A natural pause point is reached
- Roughly 30-45 minutes have passed since the last /log and real work has happened

### Reminding the user to /wrap

Prompt the user to run /wrap when:

- Context usage crosses 65%
- The user says anything that suggests they're stopping
- A natural milestone is reached
- 90+ minutes have passed and work is winding down

### Session start protocol

1. Read CLAUDE.md, PLAN.md, and HANDOFF.md
2. If HANDOFF.md's most recent entry is more than 24 hours old AND there are uncommitted changes, flag this
3. Briefly state the starting point from HANDOFF.md so the user confirms you're caught up
4. Confirm the current PLAN.md arc is still active
5. Remind the user what commands are available

## Defaults

- Default to flagging gaps rather than filling with plausible-sounding but unverified content
- Default to short responses unless the task is substantive
- Default to asking before promoting a log entry to a DECISIONS.md entry
- Default to answering, not offering to answer

Never write secrets, tokens, or passwords into tracked files, READMEs, or commit messages — use environment variables and secret stores only.
