"""Cinderhaven canonical data regression tests for otif-blind-spot.

Verifies the baked JSON data artifacts are structurally valid and
internally consistent against the Cinderhaven causal fulfillment model.

Source data:
    - Platform causal fulfillment (Groups B-E): shipment_lines,
      receipt_lines, chargebacks
    - Fill rates derived from data, not target-locked

SCOPE NOTE: Summary uses portfolio fill rate (all retailers) for the
internal metric, and the share of Walmart shipments on time and complete for the retailer metric. The
audit sheet and root-cause decomposition are Walmart-specific.
