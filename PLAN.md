# OTIF Blind Spot — Current Work Plan

The current arc of work. Updated when the arc changes, not every
session. For session-by-session state, see HANDOFF.md.

---

## Goal

Build an interactive HTML portfolio piece (React + TypeScript + Vite + D3, Cloudflare Workers) that reconciles Cinderhaven's internal fill rate against a synthetic Walmart OTIF scorecard across all 5 analytical moves, delivering the Retailer Reconciliation Matrix and EDI Audit Sheet views in the Lailara Design System.

## Why this arc, why now

Completes the short-ship workstream diagnostic leg — The 150 Cases (cost) and Production Demand Forecast (prevention) are already built or briefed; this is the missing measurement piece that reveals the problem exists and tells the brand exactly what to fix.

## Business question this arc answers

Why does Cinderhaven's 99% internal fill rate coexist with only 84.5% of Walmart shipments arriving on time and complete, which failure modes (on-time vs. in-full) drive the gap, and what is the full financial exposure — chargebacks plus shelf-velocity damage?

## Stack

- React + TypeScript + Vite + D3 (matching retailer-deduction-recovery)
- Static JSON data files in `public/` fetched at app load
- Python data generation scripts (new synthetic OTIF scorecard + 855 layer + MABD fields)
- Deployed to Cloudflare Workers via wrangler
- Lailara Design System: canvas bg, Playfair Display + Source Sans 3, SVG charts, click-to-pin

## Tasks

Work in vertical slices — one section/feature end-to-end before moving
to the next. Visualizations get reviewed in their own slice, not
deferred to a polish phase.

- [x] Run /clarify to scope the work
- [x] Run /ce:brainstorm to write the spec
- [x] Run /ce:plan to research and plan implementation
- [x] Run /ce:work — all 7 implementation units complete (51 tests, build passing)

## Analytical moves (all in scope)

1. **Dual-dock reconciliation** — internal fill rate (fulfillment dock) vs. retailer OTIF (consignee dock)
2. **On-time / in-full decomposition** — split the gap into its two failure modes
3. **Root-cause attribution** — warehouse-late vs. carrier-late vs. production short-ship vs. order trimming
4. **True fill rate** — fill against original 850 PO demand (not acknowledged 855)
5. **Exposure quantification** — OTIF fines (3% COGS) + shelf-velocity damage

## Data work required

- Existing: `fct_retailer_orders`, `fct_retailer_shipments` in Cinderhaven platform
- To generate: synthetic Walmart OTIF scorecard (consignee dock view), 855 acknowledgment layer (showing trimmed quantities), MABD fields, COGS for fine calculation
- Output: static JSON files in `public/data/`

## Out of scope for this arc

- Real-time OTIF monitoring (engagement upsell, separate project #148)
- Fixing the failures themselves (this piece diagnoses; remediation is other pieces)
- Dispute automation (deduction-recovery territory)
- Multi-retailer rule library (Walmart MVP first; other retailers in v2)

## Definition of done for this arc

- [x] All 5 analytical moves visible and accurate in the interactive HTML piece
- [x] Retailer Reconciliation Matrix view complete (internal vs. retailer comparison, on-time/in-full split, root-cause attribution)
- [x] EDI Audit Sheet view complete (transaction-level drill-down)
- [x] ~~Exposure numbers match brief: ~$140K fines + ~$320K velocity damage = ~$460K total~~ Updated 2026-06-22: 36-month window produces $24K fines + $34K velocity = $57K total after platform data tuning. Brief targets no longer applicable after platform causal rebuild.
- [x] Lailara Design System applied consistently (matches retailer-deduction-recovery visual standard)
- [x] Deployed to Cloudflare Workers and accessible at a public URL
- [x] Data paranoia: all data is synthetic Cinderhaven, no real client data anywhere

## Improvement history

<!-- Entries are added by /improve — don't delete this section -->

### 2026-05-31 — Improvement pass
- **Trigger:** User-initiated post-ship health check
- **What was reviewed:** All workflow files, code quality, tests, dependencies, documentation, git hygiene, security audit (ce-security-sentinel), code review (ce-correctness, ce-testing, ce-kieran-typescript, ce-learnings-researcher)
- **What was fixed:**
  - EDI Audit Sheet: eliminated all horizontal scrolling — `overflow: hidden` + `table-layout: fixed` + `<colgroup>` with proportional column widths
  - EDI Audit Sheet: fixed header clipping bug introduced during scroll fix (removed `white-space: nowrap` from `.audit-th`)
  - EDI Audit Sheet: added `overflow-wrap: break-word` to data cells to prevent token bleed
  - EDI Audit Sheet: drove colgroup from `COLUMNS` array (added `width` field to Column interface) — eliminates hardcoded column count drift risk
  - README: filled in Stack and "How to run" sections (were TBD since scaffold)
  - `scripts/otif_config.py`: DATABASE_URL fallback now raises `EnvironmentError` instead of silently constructing empty-password connection string
  - `domain.ts`: removed unused `DEMO_DATE` export
  - `docs/solutions/flex-min-width-table-scroll-bypass-2026-05-31.md`: updated to document Strategy B (table-layout fixed) and when to use each strategy
  - npm audit: 0 vulnerabilities confirmed
- **Deferred:** None — all findings resolved
- **Next review:** 2026-06-30

### 2026-07-30 — Improvement pass (/improve + /ce code review + /ui review)
- **Trigger:** User-initiated triple review (whole-project audit, code review, UI review)
- **What was reviewed:** Full codebase + docs. Automated reviewers: security-sentinel, correctness, maintainability, testing, kieran-typescript, project-standards. UI review (ui-review-skill) against live site. Manual audit of workflow files, deps, build, git hygiene.
- **What was fixed (14 commits):**
  - Behavior: floated headline exposure + Move-5 prose with the window (were pinned full-corpus while tiles were windowed — two exposure totals on one screen); reset audit-sheet pagination on window change (stale page → false "no matches").
  - Honesty: relabeled Move 4 "True Fill" — tiles/prose described EDI-855 order trimming, but the data has no acknowledgment layer (pipeline remaps units_shipped→acknowledged_units, units_received→shipped_units), so it's shipping-dock vs receiving-dock fill; delta is loss between docks. Fixed audit-sheet column headers to match.
  - Dead code: removed otif_fine (always 0) and retailer_penalty_flag (redundant); PlotChart.svgTitle; data-decomp-total; magic-9 decomposition fallback; dead DATABASE_URL/REDACTED branch; duplicate .env loader.
  - Quality: RootCauseKey union type (was bare string); tokens.css hex → var in ReconciliationView.css.
  - Tests: added computeMetrics.test.ts — Python/TS parity suite + edge/empty-window + exposure-math value assertions (63 frontend tests, was 50).
  - Docs: README stack (Observable Plot not D3; Workers not Pages; correct table names); CLAUDE.md TBDs filled; 84.5%/14.8pt figure alignment.
- **Verified:** tsc clean, 63 frontend + 29 python tests pass, build clean, security clean. Windowing consistency + Move 4 relabel confirmed live across 52w/13w presets.
- **Deferred:** ~~lailara-frame `.ll-measure` prose-measure adoption~~ — **done 2026-07-30** (`8a87996`, deployed; verified via computed geometry). JSON runtime validation in data.ts — intentionally skipped; the new parity test is a stronger build-time guard.
- **Next review:** 2026-08-27 (active project, ~4-week cadence)

### 2026-09-23 — Audit (health check only)
- **Findings:** 1 critical, 6 important, 4 nice-to-have
- **Top concerns:** Client mode silently scores any unrecognized pass/fail value (e.g. "Met", "Hit", blank) as a failure, so a client's OTIF and gap can be wrong with no warning (client_mode.py _to_bool; _FALSE set is unused). The pipeline's shipment query has no date filter, so ~300 Jan-2026 shipments sit inside the "Jan 2023–Dec 2025" full-corpus figures, and zero/missing receipts fall back to units shipped. README still says the hero defaults to 52 weeks (code default is full corpus), and HANDOFF/PLAN have not been updated since 2026-07-30 despite ~15 commits.
- **Action taken:** Audit only — no fixes this session
- **Next review:** 2026-10-21
